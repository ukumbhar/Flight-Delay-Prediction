# Flight-Delay-Prediction
•	Studied the 2018 US flight data consisting of over 1 million data points using Jupyter Notebook and Python Machine Learning libraries.
•	Implemented statistical analysis in R to get an overview of the flight delay patterns from the 15 min delay limit.
•	Implemented machine learning models to predict flight delay and reached an accuracy of 78 percent.
